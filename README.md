jQuery, Handlebars, MySQL, Express, Object-relational mapping(ORM)

Eat-Da-Burger App is a full-stack development app following the MVC paradigm which is short for Model View Controller. MVC is the data layer of our application concerned with the structure of our database and the logic used to retrieve that data. Object-relational mapping will be implemented to create reusable methods for querying the database. MVC is useful on a small scale, but becomes very useful when working collaboratively or adapting an application to changing technical needs.
